Title: A Factory of Self-Describing Properties
Description: Supports the definition of sets of properties on objects. Observers can listen to changes on individual properties or the set as a whole. The properties are meant to be fully self-describing. In support of this, there is a framework for defining enumerated types, as well as other bounded types, as S4 classes.
